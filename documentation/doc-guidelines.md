## Website User Documentation and Bug detection guide:

  

### Step 1

  

If you don't already have a good browser screenshot tool, now is the time to get one :)

  

I would recommend using Firefox, wich has a great one built in, but if you prefer chrome, I use this:

https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/mbniclmhobmnbdlbpiphghaielnnpgdp?utm_source=item-share-cb

  

You want a tool which:

1. Draw on the image

2. Add text

3. Copy the image to clipboard for speed (CTRL-V onto the docuemnt)

  

## Step 2

  

Create two documents in your editor of choice, but the editor needs to be good at accepting and formatting images

  

One will be the website documentation, the other will be a "Website review and bug report" for me

  

## Step 3

  

Create a system to go through all features of this website

https://team-e-toxic-trace-50672fa229b6.herokuapp.com/

An easy way is to just start in the top left of the screen, and move to the bottom right, clicking each feature as you go. 

A harder but better way, is clicking the fetaures, then afterwards rewriting the documentation in terms of "I am a user and I want to do X"

If a button is trivially obvious why its there, don't worry about the documentation. If theres no good reason you can see why its there, add it to the bug report

#### Documentation key points to answer
 - Name of the feature (if applicable) 
 - Why does this feature help the user?
 - Is there anything the user needs to know when using it?
 - Screenshot highlighting feature
 
#### Bug report key points to answer
 - What steps did I take to get to the bug?
 - Can I capture the bug in a screenshot?
 - Can I reproduce the bug a second time? How?


## Examples

### Feature example

#### My Detox Plan

My Detox Plan allows users to make real evidence based actions on how to remove toxins from the body.

The plan can be opened here:

Then, select which toxins you are focused on detoxing from:

Look for the actions that can reduce the toxins in the body:

#### Bug report example

1. Click my detox plan
2. Select all 4 toxins
3. Scroll to bottom
4. My detox plan is too big for the page ( goes off the bottom of the page )

(This isnt actually true, just an example)
