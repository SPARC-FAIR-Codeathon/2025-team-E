# Mathematical Models

This directory contains mathematical models for calculating toxin accumulation in the human body.

## Purpose

The models in this directory are designed to:
- Calculate toxin accumulation rates in various body compartments
- Model absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) processes
- Predict bioaccumulation and clearance patterns
- Estimate dose-response relationships
- Simulate physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) behavior

## Getting Started

This directory is currently under development. Please refer to the main project README for setup instructions.

## Model Types

This directory will contain:
- **Compartmental Models**: Multi-compartment toxicokinetic models
- **PBPK Models**: Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models
- **Bioaccumulation Models**: Models for calculating bioaccumulation factors
- **Clearance Models**: Mathematical representations of toxin elimination
- **Dose-Response Models**: Relationship between exposure and biological response

## Structure

Expected structure for model implementations:
- Model definition files (equations and parameters)
- Implementation scripts (Python/R/MATLAB)
- Validation datasets and test cases
- Documentation for each model
- Parameter estimation routines
- Example usage and tutorials

## Mathematical Foundations

The models are based on:
- Differential equations for compartmental analysis
- Mass balance principles
- First-order and non-linear kinetics
- Physiological parameter relationships
- Statistical modeling for uncertainty quantification

## Usage

Each model will include:
- Clear documentation of assumptions and limitations
- Input parameter specifications
- Expected output formats
- Validation examples
- Performance benchmarks

## Contributing

When adding new models:
- Include comprehensive documentation
- Provide validation against known data
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Include unit tests and examples
- Document all mathematical equations and assumptions
